# 📦 What I Learned While Creating a Dockerfile

### Two-Tier Flask + MySQL Application

This project helped me understand how to containerize a **two-tier Flask application** using Docker. The application consists of:

* **Flask application container**
* **MySQL database container**

Each container has its own responsibilities and required dependencies.

---

## 🧱 Two-Tier Architecture Overview

* **Flask Container**

  * Runs the Flask web application
  * Uses environment variables for configuration
  * Connects to the MySQL container

* **MySQL Container**

  * Runs the database
  * Exposes required ports
  * Uses environment variables for database credentials

## ⚙️ System Dependencies vs Python Dependencies

### 1️⃣ System-Level Dependencies (apt-get)

Some Python packages (like `mysqlclient`) require **system libraries and compilers**. These must be installed using `apt-get` **before** installing Python packages.

Required system dependencies:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y \
       build-essential \
       pkg-config \
       libmariadb-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### Why these are important:

| Package           | Purpose                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `build-essential` | Provides `gcc`, `make`, and C headers      |
| `pkg-config`      | Helps locate MySQL/MariaDB libraries       |
| `libmariadb-dev`  | MySQL/MariaDB client development libraries |

❗ **Without these dependencies, `pip install mysqlclient` will fail with compilation errors.**

---

### 2️⃣ Python Dependencies (pip)

After system dependencies are installed, Python dependencies can be installed using `pip`.

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, if installing directly:

```dockerfile
RUN pip install mysqlclient
```

---

## 🌱 Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the Flask application and database connection.

Example:

```dockerfile
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_ENV=development
ENV DB_HOST=mysql
ENV DB_USER=root
ENV DB_PASSWORD=password
ENV DB_NAME=flaskdb
```

This allows the Flask container to communicate with the MySQL container securely and flexibly.

---

## 🐳 Flask Application Dockerfile (Example)

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y \
       build-essential \
       pkg-config \
       libmariadb-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* A two-tier application requires **separate containers** for the application and the database
* System dependencies must be installed **before** Python dependencies
* `mysqlclient` requires compilation and **cannot be installed without `gcc`**
* Environment variables make containers configurable and reusable
* Dockerfiles should be clean, ordered, and optimized

---

## 🚀 Final Outcome

By correctly installing system dependencies and organizing the Dockerfile, the Flask application successfully connects to the MySQL container without build errors.
