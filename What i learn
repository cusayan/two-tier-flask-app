**📦 What I Learned While Creating a Dockerfile**
**Two-Tier Flask Application**

While working on this project, I learned how to create a Dockerfile for a **two-tier Flask application**. The application is divided into two separate containers: one for the Flask application and one for the MySQL database.

---

**🧱 Two-Tier Application Architecture**

This project follows a two-tier architecture:

* The **Flask container** runs the web application and handles business logic.
* The **MySQL container** is responsible for data storage.
* Both containers communicate with each other using environment variables.

---

**⚙️ Understanding System Variables and Python Variables**

In a Dockerfile, dependencies are divided into two main categories:

* **System-level dependencies**, which are installed using `apt-get`
* **Python-level dependencies**, which are installed using `pip`

Both are required for the application to work correctly.

---

**🔧 System-Level Dependencies (apt-get)**

Some Python packages, such as `mysqlclient`, depend on system libraries and compilers. These dependencies must be installed before installing Python packages.

Important system dependencies include build tools and database development libraries. Without these, Python packages that rely on native compilation will fail during installation.

---

**🐍 Python Dependencies (pip)**

After installing system dependencies, Python packages are installed using `pip`. These dependencies are usually listed in a `requirements.txt` file and are essential for running the Flask application.

---

**🌱 Use of Environment Variables**

Environment variables are used to configure the Flask application and database connection. They help keep sensitive information such as database credentials outside the source code and make the application easier to manage across different environments.

---

**🐳 Flask Application Container**

The Flask application container is created using a Dockerfile. This container includes all required system dependencies, Python libraries, and environment variables needed to run the application.

---

**🗄️ MySQL Database Container**

The MySQL container runs separately from the Flask application container. It stores application data and is connected to the Flask container through defined environment variables.

---

**🧠 Key Learnings**

* A two-tier application requires separate containers for the application and the database
* System dependencies must be installed before Python dependencies
* Certain Python packages require system-level tools to install successfully
* Environment variables make containerized applications flexible and secure
* Proper ordering in a Dockerfile helps avoid build-time errors

---

**🚀 Final Outcome**

By correctly organizing system dependencies, Python dependencies, and environment variables, the Flask application container successfully communicates with the MySQL container without installation or runtime errors.

* Rewrite it in **simple beginner language**
* Convert it into **interview preparation notes**
